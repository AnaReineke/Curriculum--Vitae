  <h3>About Me</h3>
  </p>

  <p>
    I always thought my career dream is saving lives by becoming an MD, particularly in Pediatrics or anything related to assisting others with their health challenges. It seems like an appropriate dream given my BS in Health Education and
    Behavior. Some of my relevant coursework includes
    Foundations of Health Education, Personal and Family Health, Community and Environmental Health, and Patient Education, to name a few.
    In my major coursework as well as my community health specialization coursework, I have developed an interest in healthy living and health education, as well as research, marketing, and promotions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I did it for a while and loved it; however, life itself had a different career plan for me. I have a proven ability to learn challenging concepts quickly and have developed competencies in diverse areas and must say that I am fortunate to be
    the
    character that embraces change and adapt to new paths, whatever they may be. Well, the change happened when I was introduced to the Health Informatics pathway and directed me to seek more related to data analysis, abstraction, and secure
    messaging. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different.
  </p>

  <p>
    And that’s when it happened; the spark I was missing ignited the instant I clicked play on my first SQL and PHP tutorial part of my current Master’s Informatics program. Since then, I cannot get enough. Front-end and Back-end web development
    calls to all my passions; it incorporates creativity and problem solving, and I can (allowed to) break it to improve the code. The satisfaction of the result (after hours of trying to figure it out) is extraordinary.
  </p>

  <p>
    My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem-solving, and website optimization. So far, I have SQL, Note++, PHP under my belt and started learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM Manipulation, HTML,
    jQuery,
    Bootstrap, Python, Mongoose, Node.js within my Web Development Bootcamp.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, now, in industry, this passion remains with me. There is certainly more to learn, more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very thankful.
